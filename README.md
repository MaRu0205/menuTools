# menuTools
This is the Django Delight portfolio assigned at the end of the CodeCademy Django course.
Anyone interested in accessing the admin page may create a superuser from the Python shell, or can use the following credentials to access both the admin page and the app itself
user: squog

The app has some ingredients already entered, but neither menu items nor purchases. A recipe requirement has to be added to at least one menu item, and at least one purchase needs to be made in order to populate every table item in the app.
